## Why did I start a ~blog~ journal?

### TL;DR for fun!

Honestly, I created a blog simply because I enjoy coding and tinkering with software tools.
But this isn't what I told myself as I was searching for a cool blogging platform that did exactly what I wanted.
I told myself that I _should_ start a blog, and I rationalized that I needed a blog for lots of reasons.
A few of the salient ones were:

- I own Sharrief.com!
- I build websites for a living!
- I am a great writer!
- I need to showcase my portfolio!
- I want a personal presence on the Internet!

I feel especially driven by that last one. I am very privacy-focused (ðŸ¤” I should go into detail about that in a future post),
having deleted my Facebook account back in 2015 or so.
Since then I haven't used Instagram, Twitter or any other public social platform much.
But I have times when I want to participate in the public discourse.
So I'm using my blog to do that. And I'm calling it a journal because I don't like the word blog.

Also, I like writing. I've been told a few times by my professors, colleagues, friends and family that they like my writing.
But I don't recall ever choosing to write something for my own sake. It's usually technical documents and explainers.
And unlike coding, I never made writing a hobby and never did it outside of work, although I enjoy it.
So my journal is a way for me to exercise that writing muscle, and maybe I'll build an audience along the way.

I don't want these ~posts~ entries to get too long, and I can feel a great number of things coming to mind that I want to write about in the future.
So I'll wrap this one up here.

Thanks for reading!
