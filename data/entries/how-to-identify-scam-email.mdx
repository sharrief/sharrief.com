import { UserSubmissionEmail } from '@/data/otherData.tsx'

So a friend of mine got this email:

![Screenshot of spam email on iPhone](/static/images/how-to-identify-scam-email/phone-screenshot.jpeg)

At first glance, you might not recognize the weird things about this email.
And to someone casually going through their email inbox, the overall aesthetic looks legit.
The email address of the sender, service@paypal.com, is legit.
And if you happened to click on the "View Invoice" link, you would be taken to an invoice on a legitimate PayPal website.

The website that the "View Invoice" link takes you to is www.paypal.com which we know is a legitimate website.
The reason the email and this invoice both look so legit is that they are legit because they were created using PayPal's tools for sellers & businesses.
You see, anyone can create a PayPal account, and start sending invoices.
An honest business would only send invoices for things you'd purchased.
But scammers are hijacking this feature to send invoices for things unrelated to you.
And they are making it sound scary by adding in messages like "We authorised a payment" and "auto deducted from your account."

The PayPal tools for creating an invoice allow the seller to specify information like who is being billed and what they are being billed for.
Those same tools put that information into the emails that are sent to the seller's customers from PayPal's legitimate email address.
Scammers are taking advantage of the way the emails are automatically created by PayPay.

The very top of the email is supposed to contain the customer's name.
Instead, it has a message that says "Hello, we authorised..." because this message is what the scammers entered as the customer name.
When you look at the invoice, you can see the _Bill to_ also contains this message instead of a customer name.

The scammers also included their scam 1-800 phone number in this message.
_Please don't call this number, unless you want scammers to call you with other scams_

The scammers specified their business name as "Reach us to" which is why the email has the big bold message "Reach us to canceled your invoice".
It seems that the scammers created a fake invoice, then canceled the fake invoice so that PayPal's tools would send the specific email template that it uses for canceled invoices.
Under normal circumstances, the email would say something like "Joe's Shoe Shop canceled your invoice."

Unfortunately, it does take a considerable amount of investigation to determine exactly what parts of this scam are legitimate and what parts aren't.
Email services like Gmail and Outlook do a generally good job of filtering our scam emails, but this email was sent by PayPal's systems, and spam/scam filters don't block emails from legitimate senders like PayPal.
One way to protect yourself from ever-more sophisticated scams is to **remain skeptical** of every email you receive.
Especially with emails you weren't expecting or emails warning you about money.
Always check the email address of the sender, and don't click links if you can avoid it.
It's better to go directly to the website and then sign in or search for the information in the email, when possible.

Personally, I take things a step further. I use _masked_ emails for every online service or account that I have.
A masked email is a randomized email address that forwards emails to your main email address.
For example, if I were to purchase shoes from Joe's Shoe Shop, I would create an account with (or have invoices sent to) the email address agile.zone3971@fastmail.com.
Any email Joe's Shop Shop sends to that email address will get sent to my main email address, and Joe will have no idea what my main email address is.
When the email from Joe arrives, my email service tells me which masked email it was sent to.
So I know it was from Joe because that's the only place I provided with that masked email address.
If an email about a crypto opportunity is sent to that email, I know it's a scam because Joe doesn't take crypto payments.
Also, I know that Joe must have shared my email address with someone who sold it to scammers.

Managing my personal email inbox got much easier once I started using masked email because I have email auto-categorized based on the masked email it was sent to.
And getting rid of spam is as easy as deleting the masked email address that the spam was sent to (and then updating the email address on the site I originally gave the masked email to)

I'll write a how-to on masked emails in a future article. They are easier to use than you may think.
But if you want to try out masked emails yourself, there are a few services you can use:

- [iCloud Hide My Email](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425)
- [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/)
- [Fastmail masked email with 1Password](https://support.1password.com/fastmail/#use-masked-emails) (this is what I use)

If you've got some stories about security, privacy or technology that you'd like to share please let me know and I'll see if I can share my perspective in an article.
You can email them to <UserSubmissionEmail/>.

Thanks for reading!
